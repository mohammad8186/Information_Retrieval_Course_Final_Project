# Persian Document Processing and TF-IDF Search Engine üöÄ

Unlock the power of advanced Persian text processing and search! This project leverages cutting-edge techniques to analyze and retrieve documents from a Persian news dataset (`IR_data_news_5k 2.json`). Using libraries like `Hazm` and `Parsivar`, we streamline tasks like normalization, stemming, stopword removal, and TF-IDF weight calculation. Perfectly optimized for working with Persian text, this search engine offers robust functionality for information retrieval and positional indexing.
